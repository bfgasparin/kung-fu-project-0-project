## Feng Huang Institute Docker Compose Project

This Project contains the Docker Feng Huang Institute`s Compose files  that
orchestrate all the site ecosystem.

This project can be used for development workflow.

For production, I use a private `docker-compose.override.yml`.

See `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml` files 
for more details.
